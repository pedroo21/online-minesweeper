# Online Minesweeper

This repository is an implementation of a Minesweeper game made under my Web Technologies course.
This game also integrates with a NodeJS server, providing a multiplayer functionality, although not included here.

Features:
* Improved UI
* Generate a custom matrix
* Customize the number of bombs
* Add flags and question marks (right click)
* Firework animations at the end of each game
* Opponent searching with queue
* Debug mode to uncover the bombs
